# My configuration files

The parent folders of this repository each group config files for a single
application or purpose. The config files belong into `$HOME`.

You can use [GNU stow](https://www.gnu.org/software/stow/) to link the files
into your home directory. For example, to link all vim files, execute

    git clone git@github.com:ebab/dotfiles ~/.erik-dotfiles
    cd ~/.erik-dotfiles
    stow vim

Please be sure to also check out my brother Igor's [dotfiles
repository](https://github.com/ibab/dotfiles).
